`thumbnail-diamond` is a lambda function. It takes a payload as per:

```json
{
  "mediaId": 12345,
  "posterUrl": "https://example.com/poster.png",
  "playerImgUrl": "https://example.com/player_img.png"
}
```

And dumps three images in an S3 bucket under the structure:

```
some-s3-bucket/
└── 12345
    ├── player.png
    ├── poster.png
    └── small_player.png
```

It reads in burner information from some other bucket
